## Problem Statement

The lack of structured and technology-driven recycling systems in Dhaka results in excessive waste mismanagement and inefficiency in material reuse. Households generate large amounts of recyclable materials, yet no efficient system exists to facilitate their collection and tracking.

**AlterUSE** is designed as a streamlined user-focused recycling management system that provides digital tracking and a points-based rewards mechanism to encourage recycling practices.

## Objectives

1. Develop a simple web-based platform for users to submit recyclable materials and track their submission history.
2. Implement a points-based reward system to incentivize recycling.
3. Provide users with the ability to withdraw earned points.
4. Create a user-friendly interface for account management and recycling history tracking.
